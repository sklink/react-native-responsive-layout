# React Native Responsive Layout

When developing a project that considers both React Native and React Web as first-class 
experiences, it's helpful to have tools that react different sizes of windows, both on load and 
when resized.

This package aims to replicate tools that the Material UI library has provided, while working 
for both React Native and React Web.

These Material UI components have been replicated here:

[Container](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-container/#main-content); a wrapper that centers 
your content horizontally. It's the most basic layout element.

[Grid](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/#main-content); a responsive layout grid that adapts 
to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts.

[Stack](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-stack/#main-content); though not explicitly for 
responsive layout, Stack is a simple way to manage the layout of immediate children along the 
vertical or horizontal axis with optional spacing and/or dividers between each child.
